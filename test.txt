This is time to write down a list of activities you and your family want to do this summer. 
This is an exercise that will free you from the limits of your four walls. 
Number your list from one to however far you get and maybe even write it 
down on actual paper.
This is not a homework assignment. Get the first few ideas out. Now keep going, 
because that's when the ideas get ridiculous and really fun.
Want to walk on the moon? Write it down. Want to play Quidditch with J.K. Rowling?
